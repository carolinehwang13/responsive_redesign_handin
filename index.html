    <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
    <div id="part1">
      <h2>Part 1: Indentifying Usability Problems</h2>
      <h3>Picking a Webpage</h3>
      <p>
        The webpage I chose to redesign is
        <a href="http://www.norbyscafe.com">Norby's Cafe</a>. I chose this
        website because it's for a cafe in my hometown that I go to with my
        family all the time, but their website is not very efficient and does
        not represent the cozy vibes that you get going in-person. Here are some
        screenshots of their current webpage:
      </p>
      <img
        class="image"
        src="./assets/image1.png"
        alt="A screenshot of the current Norby's webpage"
      />
      <img
        class="image"
        src="./assets/image2.png"
        alt="A second screenshot of the current Norby's webpage"
      />
      <img
        class="image"
        src="./assets/image3.png"
        alt="A third screenshot of the current Norby's webpage"
      />
      <h3>Finding Problems</h3>
      <p>This table presents some of the my findings on the good vs bad usability I noted for their current webpage.</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Good Usability</th>
          <th>Bad Usability</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <ul>
              <li>Good color contrast on main page</li>
              <li>Images have alt text</li>
              <li>Linear layout, not too cluttered</li>
              <li>HTML seems organized structurally (from what I can see)</li>
            </ul>
          </td>
          <td>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Layout is just one long scroll — could be difficult to find
                specific sections of menu because you have to scroll all the way
                down and look for it
              </li>
              <li>
                It is not clear that the items on the menu section are links to
                the online ordering website
              </li>
              <li>
                Hard to tell where to go to online order — bad learnability
              </li>
              <li>The neon yellow background could overwhelm users</li>
              <li>Text on menu section has bad contrast (yellow on white)</li>
              <li>Some items have price, some do not</li>
              <li>Difficult to see which price aligns with which item</li>
              <li>Columns on menu section are misaligned at some points</li>
              <li>There is a search bar, but it doesn’t do anything</li>
              <li>
                There is a section that I think is trying to show it on Google
                Maps, but I always only see a “Google Maps platform rejected
                your request” error
              </li>
              <li>
                It looks a little odd on larger screens because the content does
                not fill them
              </li>
              <li>Photos have a slightly disorienting border</li>
              <li>
                Even though the website does what it needs to do, I think it
                could be made more overall efficient, appealing, and informative
              </li>
            </ul>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Accessibility</h3>
      <p>
        To get a general idea of the accessibility, I put the website into WebAIM WAVE. The only error that WebAIM WAVE gave me was a “missing form label”. It
        also gave some alerts like “redundant link”, “skipped heading level”,
        and “justified text”. I agreed with the WebAIM WAVE report
        about the accessibility problems it pointed out. However, because since it is such a
        straightforward website (basically just text and images), it does not
        have many chances for it to go astray. I think that WebAIM WAVE is good
        at detecting accessibility issues when it comes to design choices that
        are represented in the code (like alt text, colors, etc.), but it
        doesn’t necessarily account for more subjective design choices, like
        layouts, which I believe are a key aspect I sought to address in my redesign.

      <h2>Part 2: Visual Redesign</h2>
      <h3>Speed Sketching</h3>
      <p>Here are 9 speed sketches I did, each in 1 minute:</p>
      <img
        class="image"
        src="./assets/speed_sketch.jpg"
        alt="My speed sketch"
      />
      <h3>Final Sketch</h3>
      <p>Using the ideas from the speed sketches above, I sketched a final idea of what I had in mind for the redesign:</p>
      <img
        class="image"
        src="./assets/final_sketch.jpg"
        alt="My final sketch part 1"
      />
      <img
        class="image"
        src="./assets/final_sketch_2.jpg"
        alt="My final sketch part 2"
      />
      <h3>Low-Fidelity Wireframing</h3>
      <p>Once I had my final sketch, I translated that into low-fidelity wireframes for different device sizes, annotating how my design addresses the usability problems mentioned above.</p>
      <p>For mobile:</p>
      <img
        class="image"
        src="./assets/Responsive Redesign-4.jpg"
        alt="Mobile low-fidelity wireframe"
      />
      <p>For tablet:</p>
      <img
        class="image"
        src="./assets/Responsive Redesign-5.jpg"
        alt="Tablet low-fidelity wireframe part 1"
      />
      <img
        class="image"
        src="./assets/Responsive Redesign-6.jpg"
        alt="Tablet low-fidelity wireframe part 2"
      />
      <p>For desktop:</p>
      <img
        class="image"
        src="./assets/Responsive Redesign-7.jpg"
        alt="Desktop low-fidelity wireframe part 1"
      />
      <img
        class="image"
        src="./assets/Responsive Redesign-8.jpg"
        alt="Desktop low-fidelity wireframe part 2"
      />
      <h3>Visual Design Style Guide</h3>
      <p>
        This is the style guide I created and adhered to for my redesigned webpage. It is also in the Figma linked below to my
        high-fidelity mockup.
      </p>
      <img class="image" src="./assets/style_guide.png" alt="My style guide" />
      <h3>High-Fidelity Mockup</h3>
      <p>Using the low-fidelity wireframes as guides, I made a more comprehensive and accurate high-fidelity mockup.</p>

    <div id="part3">
      <h2>Part 3: Responsive Redesign</h2>
        <p>Finally, using all the notes above, I coded the redesigned webpage. As someone who loves going to this cafe, I am glad that I could make a webpage that I think is as welcoming as the cafe itself. I hope you like it!</p>
